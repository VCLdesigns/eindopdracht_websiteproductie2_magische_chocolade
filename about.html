    <h1>De Nobis</h1>
    <h2>1 ) H I S T O R Y</h2>

    <h3>SEVENTIES</h3>
    <h4>the beginning</h4>
    <p>
      In the beginning, the Antoine Company was simply a wholly owned
      subsidiary of Milton Hershey’s Lancaster Caramel Company. Using
      chocolate-making equipment purchased at the Columbian Exposition in
      Chicago, the company produced baking chocolate, cocoa and sweet
      chocolate coatings for the parent company’s caramels.
    </p>

    <h4>Ronald Muyle</h4>
    <p>
      But things changed with the hiring of Ronald Muyle to sell the excess
      product to other confectioners. Antoine became even more convinced that
      his future in the candy business lay in chocolate, not caramels.
    </p>

    <h3>EIGHTIES</h3>
    <h4>Bars</h4>
    <p>
      While his company was successful enough selling sweet chocolate
      products, Antoine was certain the real market lay in milk chocolate
      bars. The problem was in developing a formula for manufacturing it
      cheaply and efficiently, while still maintaining a high level of
      quality.
    </p>

    <h4>Plant</h4>
    Antoine built a milk-processing plant on the family farm in Derry Melsele
    in 1985 and spent the next several years developing a viable formulation
    for milk chocolate.

    <h3>NINETIES</h3>
    <p>
      Dressed in hip boots, Antoine worked day and night, going back and forth
      between the condensing room and the creamery, rarely even stopping for
      meals. Finally, in 1992, he cracked the recipe and became the first
      Belgium to manufacture crispy rice bars.
    </p>

    <h3>PRIMES</h3>
    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>
      Through unceasing technological modernization, strategically astute
      acquisitions and continued new product development, The Antoine grew
      spectacularly in the last 10 years. From $334 million in 2001, the
      company’s net sales soared to $4.4 billion in 2010.
